We've created a Password Validator 
Inorder to analyze different passwords to identify its strength.
User's will create a password, the criteria for a strong password is: At least 8 characters long, must contain at least one digit (0-9), and Must contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};:'"\|,.<>?/).
A user can create a password and input it and it will be evaluated on its strength. 
Step 1: import java util to get scanner
Step 2: Create a scanner class 
Step 3: use the system println to enter their password 
Step 4: create 3 methods, for a strong character, no special character, and too short
Step 5: Run and test all 3 methods work
